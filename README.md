# Test from linux


After exp. get a shop. Can buy atoms electrons and protons. 

Atoms give a specific big buff they also create molecules somehow. Maybe diferent types of weapon.

Electrons also give effects but smaller. 


You need the correct amount of atoms and electrons. if you don't, you becomen unstable. If you get hit when unstable you lose the extra things that makes you unstable. Those things become enemmies.


You can buy protons and add them to your atoms. this will advance then into the next atom in the periodic table
